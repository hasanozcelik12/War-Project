          <p class="question">GENERAL SUN TZU KİMDİR?</p>
          <h1>THE GREATEST MILITARY STRATEGIST</h1>
          <p>
            The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born.
            The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the
            Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both
            sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn
            period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving
            King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC.
            Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art
            of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the
            subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven
            ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who
            fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in
            <span>Eastern China.</span>
